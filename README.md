# Alchemy

A collection of Python scripts that use the Atomic Simulation Environment and conditional statements to selectively alter elements from a molecular dynamics trajectory from one type to another. This is useful for dynamic visualization using Jmol or similar.

Tips: good rule of thumb, altering elements to those in the same group usually preserves correct bonding behavior when visualizing (e.g., Li -> Na, O -> S, F -> Cl). Another good choice is to swap to transition metals (P -> Fe).

Scripts are intended for repurposing, it's incredibly unlikely these scripts will produce meaningful results for you as is.
